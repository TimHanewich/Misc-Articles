# AI Readiness in Government: 3 Practical Steps for 2026
Since [the AI Boom]() began only several years ago, AI has pushed organizations to rethink the way in which they operate and deliver value to their constituents. The private sector has been in a foot race to quickly embrace new AI capabilities to improve their products and services and gain market share with customers: [Coca-Cola is using text-to-video models to create annual holiday commercials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6fByUmPuE), [Lowes deploys "Mylow", an AI shopping assistant to help customers find the right products for the right projects](https://openai.com/index/lowes/), and [Procter & Gamble is using Azure IoT to build predictive models that enhance manufacturing efficiency](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/25077-procter-and-gamble-iot-operations). 

But innovation doesn't have to stop with the public sector! The private sector, the organizations that drive society as we know it, also must embrace AI to stay up to date with modern capabilities that are now becoming expected by their residents. This can be intimidating at times for organizational leaders as it appears as unchartered territory, but it doesn't have to be so. I've laid out **three steps** leadership at every governmental agency should be considering and doing in 2026 to set their agency up for long term success in AI, proactively embracing it instead of reactively plodding through it.

## Step 1: Familiarize Yourself with what is Possible
In the past 3 years alone, there has been unprecedented levels of innovation. Companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Anthropic, and Amazon have released so many new features and new products to market that take advantage of the large language model innovations originally brought to the masses via ChatGPT. 

It can get easy to get lost trying to keep up with all the innovation - but you don't have to. First, it is more efficint to spend you time familiarizing yourself with successful case studies - take [the City of Burlington using AI Agents to track the status of building Permits with Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/18754-city-of-burlington-microsoft-power-platform) as an example. Microsoft also maintains a repository of example AI solution accelerators, specifically for government use on its [SLG Business Applications GitHub Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/SLG-Business-Applications) - full of demos, accelerators, solution files, and ideas for using AI in government, and more.

After learning more about some of the possible use cases for AI in government, you should then familiarize yourself with the underlying technology platforms that are leading the charge into this new age. Microsoft, alone, for example, has many different solutions for building AI agents, all targeting varying levels of complexity, robustness, and skill level:
- [Copilot for M365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot) - a work productivity assistant for the everyday worker, built into Office products like Word, Excel, Outlook, and Teams.
- [Copilot Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-what-is-copilot-studio) - The place to design, customize, and extend Copilot experiences for internal and external facing scenarios.
- [Azure AI Agent Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/overview?view=foundry-classic) - A managed platform to build, deploy, and scale intelligent AI agents securely.
- [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/models/openai) - enterprise-grade, secure access to OpenAI's Powerful Language Models through Azure.

While you don't need to be in depth knowledgeable about those capabilities, having a cursory understanding about each component and where they fit into the stack is helpful as you navigate the AI platform landscape and begin thinking through how you would map business project goals to technology platforms.

## Step 2: Find *the right* Problems to Solve
One of the things I hear from government leaders in my conversations is: *"We know we want to embrace AI, but we are not sure where yet"*. Given how new we are to many of these model capabilities and platform solutions, that is completely understandable.

In order to have the best odds of success in your foray into AI, it is important to find *the right* project to begin with. The goal is to find a project that is feasible and limited in scale to allow your team to have a way to learn while doing it in a not-so-visible, learner-safe envrionment, yet also select one that will have tangible business impact. 

Signs of a good project:
- **A clear, narrow scope**: the project is defined as one particular capability in an **already defined and established** business process. For example, automating document classification, or automate invoice processing, or use AI to summarize internal knowledge sources.
- **A pilot project**: a pilot project is a project that is set up to demonstrate something specific but importantly can be built, tested, and evaluated clearly and efficiently. For your first project, ensure you are selecting a business problem that is specific and can be realistically solved for within a reasonable amount of effort - your goal with this first project isn't to move mountains, it is just to get your first taste of AI helping your agency!
- **Low risk to public trust** - particularly in government, public trust is very important. The commercial sector has already seen examples of eroding trust with customers via unsuccessful public-facing deployments that weren't ready for prime time. Focus on projects that have expose minimal (or a managed level) of risk with the public.
- **Meaningful** - for your first foray into AI to be successful, the impact of the project still must be meaningful to your organization. Select a project that is core to your organizations operations and core mission. Something that staff at your agency can appreciate and validate the success of.

I'm sure there are other qualities of a great first candidate project, but those are the ones that come to mind. 

Through my work with customers, three examples stand out as great candidates that have a short time to value yet strong impact:
- An internal-facing knowledge-based agent (chatbot) that uses policy documents to assist staff in responding to public inquiries or making critical decisions.
- An extenral-facing knowledge-based agent (chatbot) that uses *alreardy* public-facing knowledge (i.e. website content, FAQ documents) to synthesize answers by summarizing content.
- A back-office embedded use of AI for something specific, such as extracing fields out of invoices using [document intelligence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ai-builder/create-form-processing-model), to assist in automating a portion of the invoice processing stages.

## Step 3: AI Readiness
McKinsey has reported that 70% of digital transformation initiative fail to meet their objectives. Particularly today, in the age of AI, this can often be attributed to [employee resistance](https://builtin.com/articles/ai-resistance-at-work) to said change.

Any organizational leader knows that *culture* is a vital part of any organization's ability to execute successfully, quickly, and efficiently. This is truer than ever with the age of AI that we are in right now. Getting staff onboard with AI and prepared to embrace it is a very important step in the planning process. 

To set yourself up for success as well as possible, prepare your staff to embrace AI in the following ways:
- Communicate *why* AI matters to achieve the strategic priorities of your agency: improving citizen services, reducing waste by improving efficiency, etc.
- Frame AI as a tool to *support* staff in their daily work, not something to *replace* them and their roles. Address fears early to clarify the intent of the AI program.
- Share success stories of other agencies that have embarked on similar transofmrative journeys with AI and have had success
- Invest in AI literacy to prepare and equip your staff to use AI and hit the ground running: Microsoft's [Power Up Program](https://powerup.microsoft.com/), [AI Learning Hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/?tabs=developer), [AI For Beginners Course](https://microsoft.github.io/AI-For-Beginners/), or even an expert-led workshop.

Another fantastic initiative I have observed and been fortunate enough to participate in is the establish of "AI User Groups", spearheaded by central IT leadership, that is designed to educate, evangelize, and inspire with emerging AI technologies, helping agenies and departments learn about what is out there and how they may be able to use it to optimize their operations. An excellent example I applaud is Texas Dept of Information Resource's (DIR) [AI User Group](https://dir.texas.gov/strategic-digital-services/artificial-intelligence-ai-user-group), coordinated by [Dave Tucker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-tucker-0620375/), that meets regularly, to share how AI is being used in Texas and Texas-based organizations, often featuring vendors to show new stuff.

Finally, for long-term success, setting up an AI Architecture Review Board at a central authority level is also something worth investing into. This central authroity reviews new proposed use of AI, evalutates their implications, risks, and advises on ways to move forward. This formal process helps as a catalyst for accelerating AI projects.
