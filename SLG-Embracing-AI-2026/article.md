Since [the AI Boom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_boom) began only a few years ago, artificial intelligence has reshaped how organizations operate and deliver value to their constituents. In only a few years, we've seen the private sector race to adopt AI, using it to enhance products, streamline services, and capture market share. For example, [Coca-Cola leverages text-to-video models to produce annual holiday commercials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6fByUmPuE), [Lowe's deploys "Mylow", an AI shopping assistant to guide customers](https://openai.com/index/lowes/), and [Procter & Gamble uses Azure IoT to build predictive models that improve manufacturing efficiency](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/25077-procter-and-gamble-iot-operations).

But innovation shouldn't stop with the private sector. Government agencies, the organizations that shape society and serve residents, must also embrace AI to keep pace with modern expectations. While this may feel like uncharted territory for many leaders, it doesn't have to be daunting. Below are **three practical steps** every government agency should take in 2026 to proactively prepare for long-term success with AI.

## Step 1: Familiarize Yourself with What's Possible
The past three years have seen unprecedented innovation. Companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Anthropic, and Amazon have introduced groundbreaking products built on large language models, first popularized by ChatGPT.

It's easy to feel overwhelmed by the pace of change, but you don't need to track every new release. Instead, focus on learning from successful case studies. For example, [the City of Burlington uses AI agents to track building permit status with Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/18754-city-of-burlington-microsoft-power-platform). Microsoft also maintains a [GitHub repository of AI solution accelerators for government](https://github.com/microsoft/SLG-Business-Applications), offering demos, templates, and ideas tailored to the public sector.

Once you've explored use cases, familiarize yourself with the platforms driving this transformation. Microsoft alone offers a range of solutions for building AI agents, each suited to different levels of complexity and skill:

- [Copilot for M365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot) – AI-powered productivity built into Word, Excel, Outlook, and Teams.  
- [Copilot Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-what-is-copilot-studio) – A platform to design, customize, and extend Copilot agentic experiences.  
- [Azure AI Agent Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/overview?view=foundry-classic) – A managed service to build, deploy, and scale intelligent agents securely.  
- [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/models/openai) – Enterprise-grade access to OpenAI's language models through Azure.  

You don't need deep technical expertise, but having a working understanding of these tools will help you align business goals with the right technology.

## Step 2: Identify *the Right* Problems to Solve
Government leaders often tell me: *"We know we want to embrace AI, but we're not sure where to start."* That uncertainty is natural given how new these capabilities are.

The key is to begin with a project that is feasible, limited in scope, but still impactful. Your first initiative should provide a safe environment for learning while delivering tangible value.

Qualities of a strong first AI project:
- **Clear, narrow scope** – Focus on a single capability within an established process, such as automating document classification or summarizing internal knowledge.  
- **Pilot-friendly** – Choose a project that can be built, tested, and evaluated quickly. The goal isn't to transform everything at once, but to gain experience.  
- **Low risk to public trust** – In government, trust is paramount. Avoid high-stakes public-facing deployments until your team has confidence.  
- **Meaningful impact** – Select a project tied to your agency's core mission so staff can see and validate its value.  

Examples of strong candidate projects I have encoutered in my work with State & Local gov leaders:
- An internal knowledge agent that uses policy documents to help staff respond to inquiries and make decisions.
- An external chatbot that synthesizes answers from existing public-facing content (i.e. FAQs, websites).  
- A back-office AI solution, such as extracting invoice fields with [document intelligence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ai-builder/create-form-processing-model), to streamline financial processes - not flashy, but *impactful*!

## Step 3: Build Your Team's AI Readiness
McKinsey reports that 70% of digital transformation initiatives fail to meet their objectives, often due to [employee resistance](https://builtin.com/articles/ai-resistance-at-work). Any organizational leader knows that *culture* is a vital part of any organization's ability to execute successfully, quickly, and efficiently. Culture is critical, and in the age of AI, preparing staff to embrace change is essential.

To set yourself up for success as well as possible, prepare your staff to embrace AI in the following ways:
- Clearly communicate *why* AI matters: improving citizen services, reducing waste, and increasing efficiency.  
- Frame AI as a tool to *support* staff, not replace them. Address concerns early to build trust.  
- Share success stories from other agencies to inspire confidence.  
- Invest in AI literacy through programs like Microsoft's [Power Up Program](https://powerup.microsoft.com/), [AI Learning Hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/?tabs=developer), or [AI for Beginners](https://microsoft.github.io/AI-For-Beginners/).  

Another effective approach is establishing **AI User Groups** led by central IT. These groups educate, evangelize, and inspire by showcasing emerging technologies. For example, the Texas Department of Information Resources runs an [AI User Group](https://dir.texas.gov/strategic-digital-services/artificial-intelligence-ai-user-group), coordinated by [Dave Tucker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-tucker-0620375/), which regularly shares use cases and vendor demonstrations.

For long-term success, agencies should also consider creating an **AI Architecture Review Board**. This central authority evaluates proposed AI projects, assesses risks, and provides guidance, ensuring responsible and scalable adoption.

## Summary
AI is no longer optional, it is becoming a core expectation of modern government. By familiarizing yourself with what's possible, selecting the right problems to solve, and preparing your workforce to embrace change, your agency can move from experimentation to execution. The agencies that act now will not only keep pace with innovation but also set the standard for how government can deliver smarter, faster, and more trusted services in the years ahead.
