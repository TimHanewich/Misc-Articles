# My Thoughts on AI: August 2024
- AI is still so new. Copilot+ PC's. Not truly built into our life yet. Foundational technology present. Look back at internet in 2002. Shell of what it is today... took time.
    - LLM inference will be commoditized. i.e. storage devices. Now so cheap for so much storage on something so small.
- The white color worker is the one in trouble.
- What will the next wave be? Robotics.
- And how will this massive in the economy change? Not "replacing", but the work of a team of 3 being done by 1 person.
    - So where do all the jobs go? Much more concentration is going to be in advancing AI. Like we are birthing another species!


## A Respect for a new way of thinking
Parameter counts in animal brains, our level of respect for that life is different.

Isn't emotion just firing of synapses? Can't NN replicate this?
