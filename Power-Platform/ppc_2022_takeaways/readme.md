# 8 Takeaways from the Inaugural Microsoft Power Platform Conference in Orlando (2022)

Last week I had the privlege of attending the very first Microsoft Power Platform Conference in Orlando Florida. This in-person, three day conference featured several keynotes from Microsoft leadership like Charles Lamana, Jeff Teper, and Scott Hanselman, 120 breakout sessions on all parts of the Power Platform, and even optional hands-on workshops to participate in. In addition to the fun I had, I've learned a lot and am documenting my **top eight** takeaways from the conference below.

## 1: Fusion development will become a major topic
I was surprised to see "pro-code" (the low-code community's term for traditional typed programming languages like C#, JavaScript, Python, etc.) have such a major role in a conference that is focused on the power of low-code/no-code development with the Power Platform. *Fusion development*, a growing topic, occurs when professional developers using pro-code languages unite with citizen developers using low-code frameworks to build solutions. The synergies of these *fusion teams* allow businesses to build better applications using both the technical expertise of the professional developer and the domain expertise of the citizen developer. 

Fusion development was a major theme at the conference this year. Many of the conference's 120 session focused on the synergies between Azure & Power Platform together and the benefits of fusion teams. For example:

- *Take advantage of Co-authoring via Git in Power Apps Canvas Apps*
- *Better together: Power Platform + Azure*
- *Power Platform for code-first developers & ISV's*
- *Using custom connectors with PVA*
- *Compliment Low-Code/No-Code with your Pro-Code Skills*
- *ALM for Citizen Devs and Code-First developers*

Given my background in traditional development with .NET, I was pleased to see this and chose sessions that generally covered this fusion development. Besides the sessions, even the keynotes (every conference attendee attended) were heavily focused on **both Azure and Power Platform**: the *It is a great time to be a cloud developer* keynote that Scott Hanselman and Julia Kasper delivered to close the conference covered everything from Azure API Management, .NET MAUI, Azure App Service, the latest C# innovations, Power Platform custom connectors, and of course, Power Apps.

It was very clear to me that, while we work with the Power Platform, a low-code/no-code development framework, collaboration with pro-dev counterparts will allow us to achieve even more. "Fusion teams" will be commonplace in the years to come.
