# How I Built Ranger: A Long Range, Web-Connected, Azure Integrated, 3D Printed Rover with an Onboard Camera

I've always marveled at how amazing it that scientists and engineers here on Earth are able to remotely control rovers on alien worlds like the moon, mars, and even asteroids and comets. For decades, these machines that operate in far-away worlds have acted as surrogates for oursevles, operating under our command allowing us to explore unchartered areas of our solar system.

I've been getting into robotics over the past several years and have always wanted to, at least to a small degree, replicate *some* of the functionality of these off-planet rovers. I've poked around at the idea a few times over the past couple years but have not felt I had the right knowledge and expertise to make this happen. 

## Project Goals
After further learning on several smaller cursory projects, I felt I could put all the pieces together to make my own long-distance rover, with the following requirements:
- **Long Range**: what I desired to build would *not* be just another RC car. While RC cars have a limited range of only about a few hundred yards (at best), I wanted to build something that would be opearable over *very* long ranges - theoretically, any distance! 
- **Long-Lasting Bidirectional Communication**: Like the rovers of NASA and other space exploration agencies, my rover must be able to maintain a constant stream of communication in both directions - the rover should constantly be *receiving* data (instructions) from an operator while also constantly *transmitting* data (telemetry) back to the operator. 
- **Transmit Imagery**: my rover must be able to transmit imagery back to the remote operator. This allows the operator to control the cover, instructing it on further movements, based upon the photos received back.
- **Battery Life**: If my rover was intended to operate over long ranges, it ought to have an endurance of many hours. The battery life of my rover should be able to sustain a single mission of at least 5-6 hours.

## High-Level Project Design
To build a rover that takes into account the above high-level requirements, I decided to use the following high-level design:
- **Phone tethering (hotspot)** - Without a doubt, the *simplest* way of achieving ultra-long range connectivity is simply having the onboard computer connect to a hotspot wifi network on a mobile phone. This will give the rover the capability of communicating over the world wide web from *anywhere* in the world (or at least anywhere with cell service!).
- **Azure Queue Storage used for communication**: To achieve long-lasting bidirectional communication over the world wide web, Azure Queue Storage provides a simple yet effective solution for facilitating communication between the operator and rover. By both reading from and writing to queue storage, the operator and rover can both send and receive messages to/from one another.
- **Capturing photos with a USB webcam and `ffmpeg`**: A very inexpensive Logitech C270 webcam will be mounted to the rover's body, connected to the onboard computer via USB. [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/), a very popular utility used by many Fortune 500 companies, will be used to continuously stream and capture new frames from the webcam.
- **4S LiPo Battery**: to prioritize *efficiency* over *performance*, the system will be a very low-voltage system (low power draw). While a 4S LiPo battery is relatively *high-voltage* and is traditionally used in *high-performance* use cases, we will regulate its voltage at a stable 5V. At this voltage, a 4S LiPo battery will last a long time!

I will be using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to 3D design my rover with each component being 3D printed on my Creality Ender 3 3D printer.

## Building Ranger
With this goal in mind, I set out to build my rover! And given its long-range goal (a new capability in my portfolio of previous designs), I named my rover **Ranger**.
