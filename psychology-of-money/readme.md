# 5 Lessons from "The Psychology of Money" by Morgan Housel
- Money is everything
    - Allows you to afford healthcare
    - Allows you to quit a job if it is keeping you miserable and away from your kids
    - Allows you to "buy more time" while you search for the *perfect* job instead of having to take a miserable one to pay your bills.
    - Having cash on hand as a buffer alllows you to not have to sell your stocks during a bear market and face loses... waiting wins.
        - "But if that cash prevents you from having to sell your stocks during a bear market, the actual return you earned on that cash is not 1% a year—it could be many multiples of that, because preventing one desperate, ill-timed stock sale can do more for your lifetime returns than picking dozens of big-time winners."
- The rich get richer and the poor stay poor because of... habits
    - Lottery example. Can't come up with $400 for emergencies but these same people spend $400 on lottery.
    - "Bill Gates understood this well. When Microsoft was a young company, he said he “came up with this incredibly conservative approach that I wanted to have enough money in the bank to pay a year’s worth of payroll even if we didn’t get any payments coming in.” Warren Buffett expressed a similar idea when he told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in 2008: “I have pledged—to you, the rating agencies and myself—to always run Berkshire with more than ample cash ... When forced to choose, I will not trade even a night’s sleep for the chance of extra profits"
- ~~"Luck" is being prepared to seize opportunity when it comes your way~~
    - Story about Bill Gates + Kent Evans comparison
- ~~How correlated are your decisions with your success/failures?~~
    - Vanderbilt - broke the law. Enron did too. Only one got caught/battled against.
    - "Failure can be a lousy teacher, because it seduces smart people into thinking their decisions were terrible when sometimes they just reflect the unforgiving realities of risk."
    - "This is not an easy problem to solve. The difficulty in identifying what is luck, what is skill, and what is risk is one of the biggest problems we face when trying to learn about the best way to manage money. But two things can point you in a better direction. Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming."
- Strenght of a financial plan (or any plan for that matter), can be determined by what % of that plan **MUST** be true for the plan to work as a whole
    - "A good plan doesn’t pretend this weren’t true; it embraces it and emphasizes room for error. The more you need specific elements of a plan to be true, the more fragile your financial life becomes. If there’s enough room for error in your savings rate that you can say, “It’d be great if the market returns 8% a year over the next 30 years, but if it only does 4% a year I’ll still be OK,” the more valuable your plan becomes."
    - "In fact, the most important part of every plan is planning on your plan not going according to plan."
- 90% of your success will come from 10% of your actions/holdings
    - "Take Amazon. It’s not intuitive to think a failed product launch at a major company would be normal and fine. Intuitively, you’d think the CEO should apologize to shareholders. But CEO Jeff Bezos said shortly after the disastrous launch of the company’s Fire Phone: If you think that’s a big failure, we’re working on much bigger failures right now. I am not kidding. Some of them are going to make the Fire Phone look like a tiny little blip."
        - And then their experiments "Prime" and "AWS" take off, driving 6% if the S&P 500's returns in 2018.
    - "At the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting in 2013 Warren Buffett said he’s owned 400 to 500 stocks during his life and made most of his money on 10 of them. Charlie Munger followed up: “If you remove just a few of Berkshire’s top investments, its long-term track record is pretty average."
    - "When we pay special attention to a role model’s successes we overlook that their gains came from a small percent of their actions. That makes our own failures, losses, and setbacks feel like we’re doing something wrong."
- Wealth is what you don't see
    - "Modern capitalism makes helping people fake it until they make it a cherished industry. But the truth is that wealth is what you don’t see. Wealth is the nice cars not purchased. The diamonds not bought. The watches not worn, the clothes forgone and the first-class upgrade declined. Wealth is financial assets that haven’t yet been converted into the stuff you see."
    - "There are, of course, wealthy people who also spend a lot of money on stuff. But even in those cases what we see is their richness, not their wealth. We see the cars they chose to buy and perhaps the school they choose to send their kids to. We don’t see the savings, retirement accounts, or investment portfolios. We see the homes they bought, not the homes they could have bought had they stretched themselves thin."
    - "one of the most powerful ways to increase your savings isn’t to raise your income. It’s to raise your humility."
    - "Be nicer and less flashy. No one is impressed with your possessions as much as you are. You might think you want a fancy car or a nice watch. But what you probably want is respect and admiration. And you’re more likely to gain those things through kindness and humility than horsepower and chrome."
- Finish with (mic drop): "I am a passive investor optimistic in the world’s ability to generate real economic growth and I’m confident that over the next 30 years that growth will accrue to my investments."
