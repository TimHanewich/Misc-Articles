I recently finished reading *The Psychology of Money*, an oustanding book by Morgan Housel, an award-winning author and venture capitalist. The book explores the ways people think about the role of money in their lives and the psychology behind their financial decisions.

I thoroughly enjoyed this read and find much value in Housel's personal philosophy on the role of money in his and his family's life. I highlight my **five key takeaways** from this book below:

## 1: Money is Everything
The saying *"Money isn't everything"* is one that you've probably heard several thousand times throughout your life. It is advice that we hear from loved ones and close friends that truly are looking out for us with their best intentions. 

But I think further clarification may be needed - *Obsession with consumption, opulence, or ostentation*, isn't everything. When loved ones tell you "money isn't everything", they're trying to warn against materialism, or becoming obsessed with the spoils of what money can bring to you.

But money is equally capable of bringing positivity to your life as it is bringing negativity. If used appropriately, money can make a world of difference in your health and happiness, improving every area of your life:
- In the event that you lose employment, with an extra 4-8 weeks of cash on hand, you have the freedom to continue your job search, looking for *exactly* the right opportunity for yourself instead of having to take the first job your to pay your bills. This extra few weeks that you bought yourself will translate to a career that you feel fulfilled in, a career that you enjoy, and an offer career that will likely be more lucrative - and the offer you waited to receive may even trump the original one you received for the inferior job!
- 

The *presence* of money is only a problem for those that have character flaws (materialism, consumerism, etc.) to begin with; the *absense* of money is a problem for everyone. 

## 2: The Rich Get Richer and the Poor Stay Poor Because of Habits

## 3: Your Plan Should Work when Things don't go as Planned

## 4: 90% of your Success will come from 10% of your Actions

## 5: Wealth is what you Don't See
