# What to do when AI comes for your job
In 2025, only three years into the "AI Boom" spawned by the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, we have already seen a number of *very* compelling examples of artificial intelligence not just *augmenting*, but *replacing* human labor. From executive assistants to HR recuirters to financial analysts and legal professionals, the sophisticated white collar jobs that were previously thought of as being "AI-proof" within our lifetime are now the first ones to be threatened by AI automation.

And as the capabilities and performance of underlying AI models continue to evolve at a break-neck pace, tech companies are working overtime to apply this new form of intelligence to the *real-world* work - the work that we have been staffing with humans!

So what should you do if AI is coming for your job? In this article I'll share my thoughts on staying employable in this new economy.

## What is an Agent?
*Agent* is a term you have almost undoubtedly come across in the past 12 months, probably a number of times. Before we dive deeper, allow me to first clarify what an agent is.

Technically speaking, an agent is a configuration of resources that surround and support an underlying large language model (LLM). These resources allow the LLM to provide you with more accurate, relevant, and tailored answers to you, while also taking action upon external systems to achieve what you've asked of it.

But non-technically, you can think of an agent as an AI with a few tools it has to complete it's mission! In the same way a waiter needs familairty with a menu, a credit card billing system, and the ability to interact with restaurant-goers in a friendly tone, an agent needs a number of tools to effectively complete its particular task.

The graphic above depicts exactly what types of resources we give to an underlying large language model to allow it do its job: 
- **Instructions** define how an agent should behave, what steps it should follow, and more.
- **Conversation History** allows the agent to understand how questions you ask now may correspond to an earlier part of the conversation.
- **Knowledge** represents the information we provide to an agent to better allow it to do its job - website content, PDF's, etc.
- **Tools** allow an agent to proactively take action against an external system you provide it

So, when you think of *an agent*, this is nothing more than a term that we give higher-level systems that provide an underlying large language model (the same model that powers ChatGPT) with resources that allow it to better serve you and the task you give it.

## The Future of Productivity: Agents in the Workplace
As mentioned in the intro, the ceiling of capaility on these *agents* only continues to rise. As the underlying large language models that power these models become more and more powerful, the range of applications of this agent technology broadens. And as time goes on, it becomes more aparent that workers are susceptible to AI filling what once were traditionally human-staffed roles.

As this field evolves and countless innovators begin applying this technology to every industry, the *composition* of team-based productivity wil also greatly evolve. Consider the graphic below:

![teams of tomorrow](https://i.imgur.com/6yKzGdy.png)

The graphic above illustrates what the future of team-based productivity will look like; both today and in years past, teams have consisted of a manager with a group of direct reports (usually 5-12 or so) directly beneath the manager, performing work to contribute to the overall mission of the team.

In the future, this will look very different. What was once a handful of employees on a team will soon become a smaller number of employees on a team, but with each employee controlling and directing the work of numerous *agents* beneath them. The team of the future - three employees, each with a team of agents helping them - will be expected to achieve an identical level of productivity/output as the team of the past with *eight* human workers!

The human employees of the future will grow familiar with using AI-based agents to assist them in their overall role objectives; what that will look like will be different for everyone, based on the type of role they are in, industry, their personal preferences, etc. For some, they may only use AI to *augment their own work*, asking misclenaneous questions. For others, agents will be used to delegate mundane tasks that the human once did, clearing menial tasks off the plate of the human for them to apply their time to the "big problems" and "big decisions" of their work.

From the employer's perspective, the cost savings of this change will be very lucrative. If we assume each employee on the team makes an average of $100,000 in combined salary/benefits per year (cost to the employer), the "team of the past" would cost approximately **$600,000**.

Now imagine the "team of the future" scenario. If we assume:
- $100,000 per employee in total annual cost (salary & benefits)
- $10,000 per agent in total annual compute costs (this is generous)

That would be a total of **$390,000** per year to maintain the "team of the future", versus the "team of the past" costing **$600,000**: *a savings of 35%* for the same output!

## Remaining Relevant
So where does that leave us - human employees in a role that, in only a handful of years, could possibly be heavily automated by AI, an inexpensive alternative to our salary and benefits?

Considering the aforementioned "future of team productivity" descried in the section above, the ability to *use agents* and *direct agents* is going to be **paramount** to remaining a productive and attractive employee in the future of tomorrow's job market.

In the transition from "the past team" to "the future team" outlined above, what determines which three of the six employees from the past will remain employed in the future and which three will go? **AI Adaptability**. Since the team of the future will be expected to deliver identical output to the teams of the past, each remaining *human employee* must learn to harness the power of our AI agent assistants to augment their own producitivy. With the help of three agents at their control, the *overall output* of each human worker of tomorrow must be approximately **double** that of the human employee of the past, without an agent. (at least with the specific ratios from the graphic above).

## If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
So, let's revisit the original question: *what should we do when AI comes for my job?*

For many, this may invoke an emotional response - one of resistance, one of fear, one of wishing we could go back to the old days when this concern wasn't a problem and job security felt strong. This may manifest as an "AI-denier" attitude, dismissing AI and its capabilities out of fear or disbelief. This will only further perpetuate your concern that your skills are slowly becoming less and less relevant in the modern age of work.

The answer is simple: **when AI comes for your job, lean into it**. If your job is truly something that *can* be automated by AI, it *will* be automated by AI - if not brought about by you, then by someone else who become proficient at applying AI to automate your role.

By *leaning into the change*, it may feel like you are further accelerating your own demise. And this may be true - the skills you developed and allowed you to be proficient and relevant in your field may become less relevant in the future. But, while leaning into the change, you are also building **a new skillset**: a skillset of *where* and *how* to apply AI to solve business challenges.

As you configure/prompt/build AI systems that automate your role, your skillset evolves from *doing that role* into *buiding AI systems to do that role*. That is a massive, and very important shift! And in the future of workplace productivity the latter skillset is **exactly** the employable skillset that will keep you relevant in the job market. For example, in a future HR , you won't ony be graded on how effectively you produce work, but also how effectively you can leverage AI agents to assist you and the team in producing work.

As described in the section above, the employable skillset of the future will *require* you to be familiar with working with and applying AI systems to complex challenges and problems. By *leaning into the change*, further accelerating the shift to an agentic future, you are positioning yourself in a place to *become* that AI power user of the future - exactly what you will be need to be to remain relevant and high-value in your work.

## Summary
So, when you see the early signs of AI agents being introduced in your workplace that may be directly replacing a core function of your role, raise your hand to help. Volunter to be on the team that is working on this AI system, configuring/prompting/building this system to replicate the work of your role. 

The role of tomorrow will indeed look different and will require a different skillset - but by leaning into the change, you are positioning yourself to be exactly where you need to be to learn these new skills that will keep you relevant in the new "agentic" future.
