# What to do when AI comes for your job
In 2025, only three years into the "AI Boom" spawned by the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, we have already seen a number of *very* compelling examples of artificial intelligence not just *augmenting*, but *replacing* human labor. From executive assistants to HR recuirters to financial analysts and legal professionals, the sophisticated white collar jobs that were previously thought of as being "AI-proof" within our lifetime are now the first ones to be threatened by AI automation.

And as the capabilities and performance of underlying AI models continue to evolve at a break-neck pace, tech companies are working overtime to apply this new form of intelligence to the *real-world* work - the work that we have been staffing with humans!

So what should you do if AI is coming for your job? In this article I'll share my thoughts on staying employable in this new economy.

## The Employable Skills of the Future
*Agent* is a term you have almost undoubtedly come across in the past 12 months, probably a number of times! Before we dive deeper, allow me to first clarify what an agent is.

Technically speaking, an agent is a configuration of resources that surround and support an underlying large language model (LLM). These resources allow the LLM to provide you with more accurate, relevant, and tailored answers to you, while also taking action upon external systems to achieve what you've asked of it.

But non-technically, you can think of an agent as an AI with a few tools it has to complete it's mission! In the same way a waiter needs familairty with a menu, a credit card billing system, and the ability to interact with restaurant-goers in a friendly tone, an agent has all the tools it needs to complete its particular job!
